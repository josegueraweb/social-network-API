# Social Network App

## Description

This repository showcases a fully functional Back End that I built for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

![Social Network App]()

## Features

Connecting to the application database enables you to view, input, update, or delete user thoughts. The Back End API also allows for the ability to add reactions to user thoughts and create a friend list with other users of the application. 

## Programming Languages and Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## How to Use the Project

NOTE: Node.js, MongoBD, Mongoose, and some sort of API management platform (i.e. Insomnia, postman) must be downloaded on to your local machine prior to using this application. 

The steps to using the app are as follows: 

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine and navigate to the app's root directory using a CLI. 

1. Run the command "npm i" to install relavent application dependecies.

1. Issue the command "npm start" to start application server.

1. Open Insomnia to create GET, POST, PUT, DELETE routes for interacting with the application database.
